    "section": "2.5 Types of Linear Programming Solutions",
    "text": "2.5 Types of Linear Programming Solutions\nWhen we feed a problem into a solver (like the Simplex algorithm), we usually expect a single, perfect answer. But algorithms are strict logicians. If we ask for the impossible or the infinite, they will tell us exactly that. In Linear Programming, there are four distinct outcomes.\n\n2.5.1 Unique Optimal Solution\nThe “Ideal” Scenario\nThis is the standard result. Geometrically, the feasible region is a polygon, and the Objective Function (the “slope” of profit or cost) cuts through the region such that it touches exactly one corner point (vertex) last.\n\nMathematical Context: The slope of the objective function does not match the slope of any binding constraint.\nEngineering Implication: There is exactly one best way to allocate your resources. Any deviation from this plan results in lower profit or higher cost.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Multiple Optimal Solutions (Alternative Optima)\nThe “Flexibility” Scenario\nSometimes, you might get a result where the solver says: “You can choose Point A (\\(x=2, y=5\\)) or Point B (\\(x=4, y=3\\)), and the profit is exactly the same.”\n\nWhy this happens: The slope of your Objective Function is parallel to one of the binding constraint lines. Instead of touching a single corner, the objective function lies flat against an entire edge of the feasible region.\nEngineering Implication: This is actually great news for a designer! It means you have flexibility. Mathematically, the cost is the same, but maybe Plan A is politically easier to implement than Plan B. You can choose based on secondary factors (like aesthetics or risk) without losing optimality.\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Unbounded Solution\nThe “Too Good to Be True” Scenario\nImagine writing a program to maximize profit, and the output is Infinity. While exciting, this is invariably a modeling error.\n\nWhy this happens: The feasible region is not closed (it extends infinitely in one direction), and you are trying to maximize in that direction. You have forgotten a constraint.\nReal-world Example: “Maximize production.” If you don’t add a constraint for “Available Raw Materials” or “Factory Capacity,” the math assumes you can produce infinite units.\nMathematical Check: In the Simplex tableau, this occurs when a variable can enter the basis, but no variable leaves (no positive ratio in the pivot test).\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Infeasible Problem\nThe “Impossible” Scenario\nThis is the most common frustration in real-world engineering. You hit “Run,” and the solver returns an error.\n\nWhy this happens: The constraints are contradictory. There is no overlap in the shaded regions. The Feasible Region is empty (\\(F = \\emptyset\\)).\nReal-world Example: “Build a warehouse that is within 5km of the city center (\\(x \\le 5\\)) AND at least 10km away from residential zones (\\(x \\ge 10\\)).” It is mathematically impossible to satisfy both.\nDebugging: You must relax (loosen) one or more constraints to find a solution.",

    "text": "2.6 Duality in Linear Programming\n\n2.6.1 The “Mirror Image” of Optimization\nEvery Linear Programming problem (which we call the Primal) has a ghostly twin brother called the Dual.\nIf the Primal problem asks: “How do I mix these ingredients to make the most profit?” The Dual problem asks: “How much are these ingredients actually worth to me?”\n\n\n2.6.2 Why do Computer Scientists care?\n\nComputational Efficiency: Sometimes the Primal problem has 100,000 constraints and is slow to solve. The Dual might have only 100 constraints and is much faster. Solving the Dual gives you the exact same optimal value (\\(Z^*\\)) as the Primal.\nShadow Prices (Economic Interpretation): The solution values of the Dual variables (\\(y_1, y_2...\\)) tell you the Shadow Price of your resources.\n\nInsight: If the shadow price of “Machine Hours” is $50, it means acquiring one extra hour of machine time will increase your total profit by exactly $50. This tells managers where to invest!\n\n\n\n\n2.6.3 The Mathematical Transformation\nWe convert a Primal to a Dual by flipping the matrix: * Maximization becomes Minimization. * Right-Hand Side (\\(b\\)) constants of Primal become Objective Coefficients (\\(c\\)) of Dual. * Constraint Matrix (\\(A\\)) is transposed (\\(A^T\\)).\n\n\n2.6.4 Key Theorems\n\nWeak Duality Theorem: The value of any feasible solution to the Maximization problem is always \\(\\le\\) the value of any feasible solution to the Minimization problem.
